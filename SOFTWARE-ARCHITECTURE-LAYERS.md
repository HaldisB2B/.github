> **üö® ORGANIZATIONAL MANDATE**  
> This document defines the **foundational architectural principles** that MUST be followed in ALL HaldisB2B projects and endeavors. It is **pivotal** that all AI agents, human developers, and team members follow these principles without exception.

---

## üéØ **MANDATORY COMPLIANCE NOTICE**

**üìã FOR ALL TEAM MEMBERS (HUMAN AND AI):**

**THESE PRINCIPLES ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE:**
- ‚úÖ **ALL projects** must follow the four-layer architecture
- ‚úÖ **ALL code reviews** must validate architectural compliance
- ‚úÖ **ALL AI agents** must reference and enforce these principles
- ‚úÖ **ALL new features** must respect layer separation
- ‚úÖ **ALL technical decisions** must align with these standards

**BEFORE STARTING ANY DEVELOPMENT:**
- [ ] Read and understand all four layers
- [ ] Identify which layer your work belongs to
- [ ] Ensure proper separation of concerns
- [ ] Validate API contracts between layers
- [ ] Check compliance with HaldisB2B architectural standards

---

## Abstract

The "best of breed" approach to software architecture in 2025 is not about a single rigid model, but about a set of principles applied to a collection of specialized, independent services. This guide outlines the logical layers of a modern system, emphasizing the principles of **loose coupling**, **high cohesion**, and **clear separation of concerns**. The goal is to build systems that are scalable, resilient, maintainable, and adaptable to future changes.

---

## The Core Principle: Separation of Concerns

Before defining the layers, we must understand the goal. We separate layers to ensure that a change in one area (e.g., changing the button color in the UI) has **zero impact** on another area (e.g., how we calculate user permissions). Each layer communicates with others through **well-defined, stable contracts**, most commonly APIs.

**üéØ HaldisB2B Implementation Rule:**
> Every layer must be able to be modified, replaced, or scaled independently without affecting other layers. If a change in one layer breaks another layer, the architecture is wrong.

---

## The Four Primary Layers of a Modern System

While variations exist, almost all modern, cloud-native applications can be understood through these four logical layers.

### 1. üé® **The Presentation Layer** (The "What you see")

This is everything the end-user interacts with. It's responsible for displaying information and capturing user input. It should contain **minimal to no business logic**.

#### **Responsibilities:**
- Rendering UI components
- Handling user interactions (clicks, forms, gestures)
- Client-side state management (e.g., what modal is currently open)
- Making API calls to the Application Layer to fetch data or trigger actions
- Client-side validation for immediate feedback (e.g., "Email is not valid")

#### **Best of Breed (2025) - HaldisB2B Standards:**

**Component-Based Frameworks:**
```yaml
Primary: React 18+ with TypeScript
Meta-Framework: Next.js (for SSR/SSG)
State Management: Zustand (lightweight) or Redux Toolkit (complex state)
Styling: Tailwind CSS 3+ (per FRAMEWORKS.md)
Animation: Framer Motion (when needed)
```

**Design Systems:**
```yaml
Component Libraries: Shadcn UI (preferred), Material UI (legacy support)
Consistency: All projects must use shared component library
Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory
Testing: React Testing Library + Jest
```

**Static Site Generation (SSG) & Edge Computing:**
```yaml
Content Sites: Next.js with SSG for instant load times
Edge Deployment: Vercel Edge Functions or Cloudflare Workers
CDN: Global distribution for all static assets
Performance Budget: Core Web Vitals compliance mandatory
```

#### **üö® HaldisB2B Presentation Layer Rules:**
1. **NO business logic** in presentation components
2. **ALL API calls** must go through the Application Layer
3. **ALL forms** must validate both client-side and server-side
4. **ALL components** must be reusable and documented
5. **ALL UI** must follow the established design system

---

### 2. ‚öôÔ∏è **The Application / Service Layer** (The "How it works")

This is the brain of your system. It contains the core business logic, processes, and rules. This layer has seen the most significant architectural evolution.

#### **Responsibilities:**
- Implementing business logic (e.g., processing a shopping cart checkout)
- Enforcing security rules (authentication and authorization)
- Coordinating with the Data Layer to read or write information
- Communicating with other services (e.g., a payment gateway or email service)
- Exposing a secure API for the Presentation Layer to consume

#### **Best of Breed (2025) - HaldisB2B Standards:**

**Microservices Architecture:**
```yaml
Default Approach: Small, independent services per business capability
Service Examples: UserService, ProductService, OrderService, PaymentService
Communication: REST APIs + Event-driven messaging
Database Per Service: Each service owns its data
Deployment: Independent deployment and scaling
```

**API Gateway:**
```yaml
Single Entry Point: All external requests go through API Gateway
Features: Routing, rate limiting, authentication, logging
Security: JWT tokens, OAuth 2.0, CORS handling
Monitoring: Request tracing and performance metrics
Tools: AWS API Gateway, Kong, or Zuul
```

**Serverless Functions (FaaS):**
```yaml
Use Cases: Event-driven tasks, image processing, scheduled jobs
Platforms: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Vercel Functions
Triggers: HTTP requests, database changes, file uploads, scheduled events
Benefits: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use, zero server management
```

**Languages & Frameworks:**
```yaml
Primary: TypeScript (Node.js) for consistency with frontend
Performance Critical: Go or Rust for high-throughput services
Data Science: Python for ML/AI services
API Frameworks: Express.js, Fastify, or NestJS
Validation: Zod or Joi for request/response validation
```

#### **üö® HaldisB2B Application Layer Rules:**
1. **ALL business logic** must reside in this layer
2. **ALL external integrations** must be abstracted through service interfaces
3. **ALL APIs** must be versioned and documented (OpenAPI/Swagger)
4. **ALL services** must implement health checks and monitoring
5. **ALL authentication/authorization** must be handled consistently

---

### 3. üíæ **The Data Layer** (The "What it knows")

This layer is responsible for the persistence, retrieval, and management of data. It is a critical component for the state and memory of the application.

#### **Responsibilities:**
- Storing and retrieving data securely and efficiently
- Ensuring data integrity and consistency
- Managing data migrations and schema changes
- Providing caching for frequently accessed data

#### **Best of Breed (2025) - HaldisB2B Standards:**

**Polyglot Persistence:**
```yaml
Relational (SQL): PostgreSQL (primary) for structured, transactional data
Document: MongoDB or Firestore for flexible, semi-structured data
Key-Value: Redis for caching and session storage
Vector: Pinecone or pgvector for AI/ML embeddings
Time-Series: InfluxDB for metrics and analytics
Full-Text Search: Elasticsearch for search functionality
```

**Managed Database Services:**
```yaml
Primary: AWS RDS (PostgreSQL), Google Cloud SQL
NoSQL: MongoDB Atlas, AWS DynamoDB
Caching: AWS ElastiCache (Redis), Google Cloud Memorystore
Backup Strategy: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
Monitoring: Database performance monitoring and alerting
```

**Object Storage:**
```yaml
Unstructured Data: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage
Use Cases: Images, videos, documents, logs, backups
CDN Integration: CloudFront or CloudFlare for global distribution
Security: Encryption at rest and in transit
Lifecycle Management: Automated archival and deletion policies
```

#### **üö® HaldisB2B Data Layer Rules:**
1. **ALL data access** must go through the Application Layer
2. **ALL databases** must be backed up and monitored
3. **ALL sensitive data** must be encrypted at rest and in transit
4. **ALL data migrations** must be versioned and reversible
5. **ALL data models** must be documented and validated

---

### 4. üèóÔ∏è **The Infrastructure / Platform Layer** (The "Where it runs")

This is the foundation upon which all other layers are built. The modern approach is to define this layer as code, ensuring it is repeatable, version-controlled, and automated.

#### **Responsibilities:**
- Providing the computing resources (servers, containers)
- Networking, security groups, and firewalls
- Logging, monitoring, and alerting
- Automating the build, test, and deployment process (CI/CD)

#### **Best of Breed (2025) - HaldisB2B Standards:**

**Cloud Native:**
```yaml
Primary Cloud: AWS (preferred), Google Cloud Platform (alternative)
Deployment Strategy: Multi-region for high availability
Security: Cloud security best practices and compliance
Cost Management: Automated cost monitoring and optimization
```

**Containerization:**
```yaml
Container Runtime: Docker for packaging applications
Base Images: Official, security-scanned images only

Monitoring: Pipeline performance and failure notifications
```

**Platform Engineering:**
```yaml
Internal Developer Platform: Self-service deployment and management
Service Catalog: Pre-approved services and configurations
Golden Path: Standardized deployment patterns
Documentation: Comprehensive platform documentation
Support: Platform team for developer assistance
```

#### **üö® HaldisB2B Infrastructure Layer Rules:**
1. **ALL infrastructure** must be defined as code
2. **ALL deployments** must be automated and reproducible
3. **ALL environments** must be monitored and alerted
4. **ALL security** must be implemented by default
5. **ALL changes** must go through proper CI/CD pipelines
