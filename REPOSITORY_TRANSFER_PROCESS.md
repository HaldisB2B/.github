# Repository Transfer Process - HaldisB2B

## When Repository Transfer is Needed

### Common Scenarios
1. **Wrong Organization**: Business project created in personal account
2. **Mixed Ownership**: Personal content in business repository
3. **Scope Change**: Project ownership shifting between personal/business

### Example Case: NextGen CI/CD Repository
- **Problem**: `Shamdon/haldisb2b-nextgen-cicd` (wrong location)
- **Solution**: `HaldisB2B/nextgen-cicd` (correct location)

## üö® Emergency Transfer Process

### Step 1: Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. STOP all development on misplaced repository
echo "‚õî DEVELOPMENT FREEZE on wrong repository"

# 2. Create issue in correct organization
# Title: "URGENT: Transfer [repo-name] to correct organization"
# Include: Content inventory, transfer timeline

# 3. Notify team of temporary freeze
echo "üì¢ Team notification: Repository location correction in progress"
```

### Step 2: Content Inventory (5-15 minutes)

```bash
# Document all content that needs transfer
git log --oneline -20                    # Recent commits
find . -name "*.md" -o -name "*.json"   # Important files
git branch -a                           # All branches
git tag                                 # All tags

# Create content manifest
echo "üìã Content to transfer:"
echo "- README.md and documentation"
echo "- Source code and scripts"
echo "- CI/CD workflows"
echo "- Configuration files"
echo "- Git history (if needed)"
```

### Step 3: Correct Repository Creation (15-30 minutes)

```bash
# Create repository in correct organization
# Use proper naming: descriptive-business-name (not user-prefixed)

# Repository settings:
# - Owner: HaldisB2B (not personal account)
# - Name: nextgen-cicd (not haldisb2b-nextgen-cicd)
# - Description: [Business purpose] for HaldisB2B
# - Visibility: Private (typically)
```

### Step 4: Content Transfer (30-60 minutes)

```bash
# Option A: Fresh start (recommended for clean history)
git clone https://github.com/HaldisB2B/new-repo.git
cd new-repo

# Copy files from wrong location
cp -r /path/to/wrong-repo/* .
git add .
git commit -m "Transfer content from misplaced repository

Content transferred from: Wrong-Org/wrong-name
New location: HaldisB2B/correct-name
Reason: Correct organizational ownership

# Option B: Full history transfer (if history is critical)
git remote add old-repo https://github.com/Wrong-Org/wrong-repo.git
git fetch old-repo
git merge old-repo/main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

### Step 5: Validation (60-75 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Verify all content transferred
diff -r old-repo-dir new-repo-dir

# 2. Test functionality
npm install
npm run emergency:health-check  # If applicable
npm test                        # If tests exist

# 3. Update references
grep -r "Wrong-Org\|wrong-name" .  # Find old references
# Update all found references to new location

# 4. Add ownership validation
cp .github/workflow-templates/ownership-validation.yml .github/workflows/
```

### Step 6: Documentation Updates (75-90 minutes)

```bash
# Update all documentation
# 1. README.md - correct repository references
# 2. package.json - @haldisb2b scope if applicable
# 3. CI/CD workflows - organization-specific settings
# 4. Internal documentation - update links

# Commit updates
git add .
git commit -m "Update documentation for correct repository location

- Fixed all references to correct HaldisB2B organization
- Updated package scope to @haldisb2b
- Corrected documentation links
- Added organizational context

### Step 7: Cleanup (90-120 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Verify new repository is fully functional
# 2. Update team access and permissions
# 3. Archive or delete old repository
# 4. Update project tracking systems
# 5. Notify team of new location

echo "‚úÖ Transfer complete:"
echo "Old: Wrong-Org/wrong-name (ARCHIVED)"
echo "New: HaldisB2B/correct-name (ACTIVE)"
```

## üîß Automation Scripts

### Quick Content Comparison
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# compare-repos.sh
OLD_REPO=$1
NEW_REPO=$2

echo "Comparing repositories..."
echo "OLD: $OLD_REPO"
echo "NEW: $NEW_REPO"

# Compare file structures
find $OLD_REPO -type f | sort > /tmp/old-files
find $NEW_REPO -type f | sort > /tmp/new-files
diff /tmp/old-files /tmp/new-files

echo "File comparison complete"
```

### Reference Update Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# update-references.sh
OLD_ORG="Wrong-Org"
OLD_NAME="wrong-name"
NEW_ORG="HaldisB2B"
NEW_NAME="correct-name"

# Update all text references
find . -type f \( -name "*.md" -o -name "*.json" -o -name "*.yml" \) \
  -exec sed -i "s|$OLD_ORG/$OLD_NAME|$NEW_ORG/$NEW_NAME|g" {} +

echo "References updated from $OLD_ORG/$OLD_NAME to $NEW_ORG/$NEW_NAME"
```

## üìû Emergency Contacts

### If Transfer Gets Complicated
1. **Pause the process** - don't force it
2. **Document current state** - what's transferred, what isn't
3. **Create detailed issue** - include all steps taken
4. **Get team input** - multiple perspectives help

### Communication Template
```
üö® Repository Transfer Status Update

Repository: [name]
Status: [In Progress/Blocked/Complete]
Old Location: [org/repo]
New Location: [org/repo]

Progress:
‚úÖ [completed items]
üîÑ [in progress items]
‚ùå [blocked items]

Next Steps:
1. [immediate next action]
2. [follow-up action]

ETA: [realistic estimate]
```

## üí° Prevention for Future

### Repository Creation Validation
- Use checklist in REPOSITORY_CREATION_CHECKLIST.md
- Add ownership validation workflows
- Verify organization before first commit
- Team review for critical repositories

### Early Detection
- Regular organization audit
- Automated ownership scanning
- Team awareness training
- Clear escalation procedures
