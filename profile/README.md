## Our Philosophy

**AI changes how fast we can code, not how well we must code.**

We believe in:
- **Brutal Honesty** - No sugar-coating, transparent AI decisions
- **Spec-Driven Development** - Write the what and why before the how
- **Types → Tests → Architecture** - This order matters, this order is law
- **Local-First** - Privacy and control by default, cloud by choice

## Technology Stack

**Core Technologies:**
- TypeScript 5+ (strict mode)
- React 18+ with Vite
- Tailwind CSS 3+
- PNPM workspaces

**Specialized Tools:**
- **Text Editing:** Lexical (Meta)
- **State Management:** Zustand + XState  
- **Backend:** Supabase
- **Testing:** Vitest + Playwright

## Join Us

We're pushing the boundaries of what's possible when humans and AI work together effectively. Every project demonstrates that AI can accelerate development while maintaining—and even improving—code quality.

**The goal isn't to use AI everywhere—it's to use AI where it multiplies human capability without dividing code quality.**

*In the race between AI capabilities and engineering wisdom, we choose to run faster together.*
