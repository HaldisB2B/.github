## üìä **UNIVERSAL AUTOMATION ARCHITECTURE**

### **Information Flow Automation (99%+)**
```yaml
Automated Information Pipeline:

1. Information Creation (Human/Agent):
   - Git commit triggers immediate processing
   - Documentation update triggers agent notification
   - Status change triggers cross-system updates
   - Decision logging triggers transparency workflow

2. Automated Distribution (100% automated):
   - Wiki system updates within 15 seconds
   - Agent context refresh across ALL agents
   - Cross-repository synchronization
   - Team member notification via preferred channels

3. Agent Processing (99% automated):
   - Automatic relevance assessment
   - Context integration without human intervention
   - Action item identification and execution
   - Cross-agent coordination and conflict resolution

4. Verification and Compliance (95% automated):
   - Information delivery confirmation
   - Agent comprehension verification
   - Action completion tracking
   - Compliance monitoring and reporting
```

### **Agent Awareness System**
```yaml
MANDATORY Agent Capabilities:

Universal Monitoring:
  - Monitor ALL repository activities automatically
  - Track ALL documentation changes in real-time
  - Observe ALL team member activities
  - Detect ALL system status changes

Automatic Context Updates:
  - Refresh agent context every 30 seconds maximum
  - Integrate new information immediately
  - Update working knowledge base continuously
  - Maintain awareness of ALL organizational activities

Autonomous Response:
  - React to relevant information without prompting
  - Initiate required actions automatically
  - Coordinate with other agents seamlessly
