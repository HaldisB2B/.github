## Original Vision

Building a unified knowledge management system using PocketBase as the foundation for consistent UI/UX across all company services and client projects.

### Core Concept: "Company Knowledge Brain"
- All tech discoveries automatically categorized
- Multiple input channels (email, Slack, direct entry)
- Consistent PocketBase-powered UI across projects
- AI-powered auto-categorization and retrieval

---

## Proposed Tech Stack

### Framework Choices (⚠️ CONFLICTS WITH STANDARDS)
- **PocketBase** - Universal UI/Admin layer
- **Next.js + TypeScript** - Frontend framework (**CONFLICTS**: We use React + Vite)
- **shadcn/ui + Magic UI** - Component libraries (**CONFLICTS**: We use pure Tailwind)
- **Cook Portfolio Template** - Design system starting point

---

## Architecture Proposal

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Consistent PocketBase UI        │  ← Same look/feel everywhere
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│        Business Logic Layer        │  ← Custom APIs & MCP servers
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│    Specialized Services Below       │  ← AI, workflows, databases
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Knowledge Auto-Categorization Flow
```
📧 Input: "Found this cool Chinese LLM called DeepSeek"
    ↓ (AI processes & categorizes)
📁 Sorted to: /techstack/ai-models/llms/chinese/
    ↓ (Auto-tagged)
🏷️ Tags: "LLM, Chinese, evaluation-needed, 2025"
```

## Valuable Insights to Extract

### ✅ Knowledge Management Patterns
- **Auto-categorization**: AI-powered tech discovery organization
- **Multiple Input Channels**: Email, Slack, API, browser extension
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Structured knowledge taxonomy
- **Rich Metadata**: Search capabilities and relationship mapping

### ✅ User Experience Innovations
- **Simplified AI Settings**: "Fact-based ████████░░ Creative" sliders
- **Unified Interface**: Consistent admin experience across services
- **Client Comfort**: Familiar interface reduces training overhead

### ✅ Business Value Propositions
- One codebase for all admin interfaces
- Consistent training across services
- Rapid deployment via database collections
- Easy maintenance and updates

## Conflicts with HaldisB2B Standards

### Framework Alignment Issues
| Component | Proposed | HaldisB2B Standard | Decision |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Frontend | Next.js | React + Vite | **KEEP STANDARD** - No compelling technical case for SSR |
| Styling | shadcn/ui | Pure Tailwind CSS | **KEEP STANDARD** - Maintains AI-friendliness |
| Database | PocketBase | Supabase | **NEEDS ADR** - Evaluate technical merits |
| Build Tool | Next.js Webpack | Vite | **KEEP STANDARD** - Faster development |

### Architectural Philosophy Conflicts
- **Centralized vs Distributed**: Conflicts with our `.project/memory.md` approach
- **Low-code vs Code-first**: Conflicts with our AI-transparent development philosophy
- **Single System vs Specialized Tools**: May create vendor lock-in

---

## Implementation Recommendation

### Phase 1: Evaluate Core Value
- Create ADR for PocketBase vs Supabase comparison
- Test knowledge auto-categorization concept with existing tools
- Prototype user-friendly AI settings interface

### Phase 2: Align with Standards
- Implement knowledge management using React + Vite + Supabase
- Enhance existing `.project/memory.md` with auto-categorization
- Create consistent UI components within Tailwind framework

### Phase 3: Gradual Integration
- Build browser extension for knowledge capture
- Implement email/webhook ingestion
- Deploy pilot project maintaining framework standards

---

## Original Implementation Phases
*(Preserved for reference)*

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Set up PocketBase locally
2. Clone and customize Cook portfolio template
3. Create basic knowledge base schema

### Phase 2: Intelligence Layer
1. Add MCP server integration
2. Implement AI-powered categorization
3. Build email/webhook ingestion

### Phase 3: Expansion
1. Add Slack integration
2. Build browser extension
3. Create advanced search and retrieval
4. Deploy first client project using the system

---

## Next Actions Required

1. **Create ADR**: PocketBase vs Supabase technical comparison
2. **Update FRAMEWORKS.md**: Add knowledge management patterns
3. **Enhance AGENTS.md**: Include auto-categorization workflows
4. **Team Communication**: Explain why certain proposals conflict with standards

---

## Key Takeaways

**Valuable Concepts:**
- Knowledge auto-categorization is powerful
- User-friendly AI interfaces reduce barriers
- Consistent UI/UX across projects has business value

**Must Resolve:**
- Framework choice conflicts with established standards
- Centralized vs distributed knowledge architecture
- Technical evaluation needed before architectural decisions

*This exploration contains valuable insights but requires alignment with organizational standards before implementation. The core knowledge management concepts should be extracted and integrated into existing frameworks rather than creating a parallel system.*

**Status**: Archived pending proper technical evaluation and standards alignment.
