# CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md - AI Development Project Context

## Project Context for AI Development

### Mission Statement
Build an intelligent prompt management system that uses AI for organization while maintaining complete transparency of AI decision-making processes.

### Core Innovation
Combine semantic AI clustering with radical transparency - every AI decision is explainable, reviewable, and overridable by users.

### Development Philosophy
- **AI Assists, Humans Decide**: AI provides suggestions and analysis, humans make final decisions
- **Transparency First**: Every AI action must be explainable in human terms
- **User Agency**: Users can always override AI suggestions and provide feedback
- **Quality Gates**: AI-generated code and decisions undergo same review as human work

### Technical Context
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first, maintainable styles
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Realtime)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI embeddings + custom clustering algorithms

### AI Integration Strategy
- **Semantic Understanding**: Use embeddings for prompt similarity
- **Clustering Intelligence**: Automatic grouping with human-readable explanations
- **Search Enhancement**: Natural language to structured queries
- **Decision Transparency**: Log all AI reasoning for user review

### Success Metrics
- **User Productivity**: 3x faster prompt discovery vs manual browsing
- **AI Accuracy**: 85%+ user acceptance of AI clustering suggestions
- **Transparency Effectiveness**: Users understand and trust AI decisions
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with < 500ms search response times

### Quality Standards
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, 80%+ test coverage
- **AI Quality**: All AI decisions logged with confidence scores
- **Security**: Row Level Security, encrypted data, audit trails
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals compliance, optimized bundle size
