# Prompt Management System

**AI-Powered Prompt Organization with Semantic Clustering**

An intelligent prompt repository that uses AI for semantic clustering, connection discovery, and natural language search while maintaining complete transparency of AI decisions.

## Key Features

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Organization
- **Semantic Clustering**: Automatically groups related prompts using AI embeddings
- **Smart Search**: Natural language queries with vector similarity matching
- **Connection Discovery**: Finds unexpected relationships between prompts
- **Transparent AI**: Every AI decision explained with confidence scores

### üîç Advanced Search
- **Multi-Modal Search**: Combines vector similarity, keyword, and tag search
- **Natural Language Queries**: Search using conversational language
- **Relevance Scoring**: AI-powered ranking with explainable results
- **Search Suggestions**: Proactive recommendations based on usage patterns

### üë• Collaboration Features
- **Secure Sharing**: Team collaboration with proper access controls
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live synchronization across team members
- **Permission Management**: Granular control over prompt visibility
- **Export/Import**: Bulk operations for prompt collections

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Realtime)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI embeddings with custom clustering algorithms
- **State Management**: Zustand for simple, TypeScript-first state handling
