## Current Situation Assessment

### **Failure Pattern Analysis:**
```yaml
Project Failures: 7 consecutive projects
Common Issues Identified:
  - Insufficient requirement understanding
  - Lack of established pattern recognition  
  - Missing quality validation processes
  - Inadequate guidance and oversight
  - Possible overconfidence leading to rushed implementation
  
Underlying Strengths:
  - Willingness to attempt complex projects
  - Persistent effort (7 attempts shows determination)
  - Likely has foundational technical knowledge
  - Contributed at least one valuable thing (mentioned by user)
```

### **Recovery Strategy Philosophy:**
**"Build confidence through consistent small wins, then gradually scale complexity"**

- **Documentation-first learning** (eliminates token cost pressure)
- **Structured mentor oversight** (prevents repeat failures)
- **Pattern-based development** (builds on proven approaches)
- **Celebration of progress** (rebuilds confidence)
- **Gradual independence** (sustainable long-term growth)

- Develop pattern recognition skills
- Build confidence through knowledge mastery

#### **Required Reading & Study:**
```yaml
Organizational Documentation:
  - [ ] AGENTS.md - Development standards and philosophy

**Jules Answer**: [documented response]
**Mentor Evaluation**: [pass/needs-review/fail]

## Pattern Recognition Test
**Question**: Given this code sample, identify which HaldisB2B pattern it follows and what could be improved
**Code Sample**: [provided by mentor]
**Jules Analysis**: [documented response]
**Mentor Evaluation**: [pass/needs-review/fail]

## Problem Analysis Test
**Question**: Review this failed project scenario and identify likely causes
**Scenario**: [similar to Jules' past failures]
**Jules Analysis**: [documented response]
**Mentor Evaluation**: [pass/needs-review/fail]

## Success Criteria for Phase 1 Completion:

- [ ] Exhibits learning mindset and receptiveness to guidance
```

### **Phase 2: Guided Implementation (Weeks 3-6)**
*Token Cost: Low - Structured mentoring with specific scope*

#### **Implementation Philosophy:**
**"Plan first, code second, never skip the planning phase"**

#### **Task Assignment Process:**
```yaml
1. Mentor Selection:
   - Claude Code (primary mentor)
   - Human developers (backup mentors)
   - Other successful agents (peer examples)

2. Task Assignment Workflow:
   - Mentor assigns very specific, small task
   - Jules creates implementation plan using template
   - Mentor reviews and approves plan BEFORE coding
   - Jules implements only after plan approval
   - Mentor reviews code with detailed feedback
   - Success documented, failures analyzed for learning

3. Task Progression:
   - Start with minimal complexity
   - Increase complexity only after consistent success
   - Each task builds on previous successful patterns
```

#### **Phase 2 Task Examples:**
```yaml
Week 3 Tasks (Minimal Complexity):
  - Add single API endpoint following exact existing pattern
  - Fix specific documentation typo/improvement
  - Add single unit test following established pattern
  - Update configuration following documented procedure

Week 4 Tasks (Basic Implementation):
  - Implement single UI component following design spec
