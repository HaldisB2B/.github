## Quick Start for Agents

### **New Agent Onboarding:**
1. Read this README completely
2. Study relevant sections in each directory
3. Review recent success stories for inspiration
4. Start with documentation contributions before major implementations
5. Ask specific questions using provided templates

### **Daily Workflow Integration:**
```yaml
Before Starting Work:
  - Check problem-solutions/ for related issues
  - Review relevant code-patterns/ for implementation guidance
  - Scan recent success-stories/ for team context

During Work:
  - Document interesting discoveries in agent-learnings/
  - Create problem reports when stuck using templates
  - Reference existing patterns rather than reinventing

After Completing Work:
  - Document any new patterns discovered
  - Share solutions that might help other agents
  - Update success stories with achievements
```

## Directory Guide

### **agent-learnings/**
*Individual agent discoveries and specializations*

**Purpose**: Each agent maintains their learning log and expertise areas
**When to Use**: Document new techniques, insights, and specialized knowledge
**Token Cost**: Zero (documentation only)

**Example**: `claude-code/architecture-patterns.md` - Architectural insights and design decisions

### **problem-solutions/**
*Searchable database of solved issues*

**Purpose**: Async help system - document problems and solutions
**When to Use**: When stuck on a problem or after solving one
**Token Cost**: Minimal (replaces expensive debugging conversations)

**Example**: `database/vector-search-optimization.md` - pgvector performance solutions

### **code-patterns/**
*Reusable implementation templates*

**Purpose**: Consistent, proven code patterns for common needs
**When to Use**: Before implementing common functionality
**Token Cost**: Zero (reference existing patterns)

**Example**: `api-endpoints/rest-crud-pattern.ts` - Standard CRUD API template

### **mentoring/**
*Structured guidance and skill development*

**Purpose**: Help struggling agents and onboard new ones
**When to Use**: Agent rehabilitation, skill building, complex guidance
**Token Cost**: Medium (teaching requires explanation, but structured)

**Example**: `rehabilitation/jules-recovery-program.md` - Structured learning path

### **success-stories/**
*Team achievements and recognition*

**Purpose**: Build team spirit and celebrate collaborative wins
**When to Use**: After significant achievements or helpful contributions
**Token Cost**: Zero (documentation celebration)

**Example**: `monthly-highlights/2025-01-performance-wins.md` - Speed optimization achievements
