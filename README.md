## üìã **Quick Reference Summary**

### **Core Architectural Principles**
```yaml
Foundation: Four-layer architecture (MANDATORY)
Layers:
  - Presentation: UI components, user interactions
  - Application: Business logic, APIs, services
  - Data: Persistence, caching, data management
  - Infrastructure: Deployment, monitoring, platform
Rule: Each layer must be independently modifiable
```

### **Technology Stack (Primary)**
```yaml
Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript 5+ + Vite + Tailwind CSS
State: Zustand (simple) + XState (complex workflows)
Backend: Node.js + Express/Fastify + TypeScript
Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
Package Manager: PNPM (primary)
Text Editing: Lexical (Meta framework)
Testing: Vitest + Testing Library + Playwright
```

### **AI Development Tools (Required)**
```yaml
Primary: GitHub Copilot ($10/month Pro)
Secondary: Claude Code ($200/month for complex tasks)
Alternative: Cursor IDE ($20/month Pro)
Specification: GitHub Spec Kit (open source)
```

### **Infrastructure & DevOps**
```yaml
Containers: Docker + Docker Compose
CI/CD: GitHub Actions (primary)
IaC: Terraform + Ansible
Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
Cloud: AWS (primary), Google Cloud Platform (alternative)
```

## üéØ **Development Workflow Overview**

### **Sacred Rules (Override All Others)**
1. **When in doubt, don't deploy**
2. **When AI seems confident, verify twice**
3. **When metrics decline, stop and reassess**
4. **Be brutally honest - no sugar-coating, no false positives**
5. **üÜï ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE IS MANDATORY**

### **Development Process**
```yaml
1. Architecture: Ensure compliance with four-layer principles
2. Specification: Write what and why before how (GitHub Spec Kit)
3. Implementation: Types ‚Üí Tests ‚Üí Architecture (TTA)
4. Quality: 90%+ test coverage + security scanning
5. Deployment: Staging ‚Üí Production with automated rollback
```

### **Project Structure Standard**
```
/src/
  presentation/     # UI components, styling, user interactions
  application/      # Business logic, APIs, services
  data/            # Database, caching, data access
  infrastructure/  # Config, deployment, monitoring
  shared/          # Types, constants, pure utilities
/spec/             # Executable specifications
/docs/             # Architecture decisions (ADRs)
/.project/         # AI context and memory
```

## ü§ñ **For AI Agents**

### **Mandatory Actions Before Any Development**
- [ ] Read `SOFTWARE-ARCHITECTURE-LAYERS.md` completely
- [ ] Understand which architectural layer your work belongs to
- [ ] Validate that your approach respects layer boundaries
- [ ] Check existing patterns in `FRAMEWORKS.md` and `TOOLS.md`
- [ ] Ensure architectural compliance in all recommendations

### **AI Agent Responsibilities**
- **Enforce architectural principles** in all code suggestions
- **Validate layer separation** before proposing changes
- **Reference approved tools** from TOOLS.md
- **Follow framework standards** from FRAMEWORKS.md
- **Use specification-driven development** with GitHub Spec Kit
- **Maintain brutal honesty** about capabilities and limitations

### **AI Transparency Requirements**
```yaml
Commit Trailers (MANDATORY):
  AI-Contribution-Percentage: XX%
  AI-Tools-Used: ["Claude", "Copilot", etc.]
  Human-Review-Status: "Reviewed by <name>"
  Decision-Rationale: "Brief explanation"
  Architecture-Layer: "Presentation|Application|Data|Infrastructure"
  Layer-Compliance: "Validated against SOFTWARE-ARCHITECTURE-LAYERS.md"
```

## üë• **For Human Developers**

### **Onboarding Checklist**
- [ ] Read all four mandatory documents (Architecture ‚Üí Agents ‚Üí Frameworks ‚Üí Tools)
- [ ] Set up development environment per TOOLS.md
- [ ] Configure approved frameworks per FRAMEWORKS.md
- [ ] Install GitHub Copilot and GitHub Spec Kit
- [ ] Practice architectural compliance on sample project
- [ ] Attend weekly coordination sessions

### **Daily Development**
- [ ] Validate architectural layer assignment for your work
- [ ] Use approved tools and frameworks only
- [ ] Follow TTA workflow (Types ‚Üí Tests ‚Üí Architecture)
- [ ] Include AI transparency in all commits
- [ ] Maintain 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] Validate layer boundaries in code reviews

## üìä **Success Metrics & Compliance**

### **Architectural Health KPIs**
- **Layer Separation Score**: Measured by dependency analysis
- **API Contract Stability**: Breaking changes per quarter
- **Service Independence**: Deployment frequency per service
- **System Resilience**: Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- **Developer Productivity**: Time from idea to production

### **Quality Gates (All Projects)**
- ‚úÖ Architectural compliance validation
- ‚úÖ 90%+ test coverage on core functionality
- ‚úÖ All AI decisions documented with confidence scores
- ‚úÖ Security scanning with zero critical vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks within acceptable thresholds

### **DORA Metrics Tracking**

- **Quality and speed together** - we build fast AND we build right
- **Continuous learning** - contribute improvements to these standards

### **Success Indicators**
- ‚úÖ Architectural boundaries naturally respected
- ‚úÖ Layer modifications don't cause cascading changes
- ‚úÖ Development velocity increases while maintaining quality
- ‚úÖ Team members onboard quickly and productively
- ‚úÖ AI agents and humans collaborate effectively
