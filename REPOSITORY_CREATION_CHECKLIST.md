# Repository Creation Checklist - HaldisB2B

## üö® BEFORE Creating Any Repository

### Step 1: Ownership Validation

**Ask these questions FIRST:**

- [ ] Is this a HaldisB2B business project?
- [ ] Will this be maintained by the HaldisB2B team?
- [ ] Does this serve a business purpose?
- [ ] Is this NOT a personal/learning project?

**If ANY answer is NO ‚Üí Create in personal account (Shamdon)**
**If ALL answers are YES ‚Üí Create in HaldisB2B organization**

### Step 2: Repository Information

- [ ] **Name**: Clear, business-focused naming
- [ ] **Description**: Includes "HaldisB2B" and business purpose
- [ ] **Visibility**: Private for internal projects
- [ ] **Organization**: `HaldisB2B` (not personal account)

### Step 3: Initial Setup

- [ ] **README.md**: Must include HaldisB2B context
- [ ] **package.json**: Use `@haldisb2b/` scope if applicable
- [ ] **LICENSE**: Appropriate for business use
- [ ] **Ownership validation**: Add workflow template

# 1. Verify organization
echo "Creating repository in: HaldisB2B organization"
